in WMO 386, there are three concepts expressed in T1T2.

  - what is the data partaining to?  (Surface, upper air, etc...)
  - who is it for ( public, marine, aviation, etc...)
  - how is it encoded ( TAC, TDCF, etc...)
  - when... (routine, interim synoptic, synoptic, speci)

Data
----

Singular is used throughout, because otherwise everything would be plural,
and it leads to many occurrences of the word 's', with out any concomitant clarification.

Product pertinence: aloft,clouds,aviation,land,water,ocean,marine
*surface* is an odd choice for observations, since it leads to confusion with water/lake/ocean
where use of the word surface is more common. *land*, *ground*

*upper-air* replaced by *aloft* aloft vs. cloud... hmm... can they be combined?

ocean vs. marine, vs. sea vs. coast.
sea is shorter than ocean. used ocean throughout, as the more general term.


Gridded and grib data represents NWP products, so it could all be grouped
under model ?  model/prediction  model/analysis

Nothing is plural.

Audience
--------

hmm.. 
SA's:
   observations/surface ?
   observations/surface/aerodrome  ?
   observations/aviation/ ?

aviation, marine, ...

Encoding
--------

The encoding should be expressed, as is universally done
in other domains, using file type suffixes.

file types:
        .txt for TAC
        .bufr for BUFR
        .crex for CREX
        .grib for grib

There is a mixture of data type (observation), with encoding
(METAR, BUFR, etc...) in the new scheme, type is taken care of
by file extension (.txt or .metar? for those, .bufr for the other)
so encoding information is elided from the topic tree.

for for example T1=D,G,H all become "model"
