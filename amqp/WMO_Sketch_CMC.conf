# Two protocol versions available:  
#  v02 - stable for last four years, AMQP only, limited to 255 character headers.
#        specification: https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia/blob/master/doc/sr_post.7.rst
#  v03 - new JSON based format with much longer headers and includes changes suggested by WMO reviewers.
#        specification: https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia/blob/master/doc/sr_postv3.7.rst
#  
#  currently (2019/03/02) hpfx is only producing v02. 
#    Sarracenia can produce v03, so one can combine receipt of v02 (topic_prefix) with 
#    post_topic_prefix v03.post for consumption by peers.
#

# default is to use v02.
#topic_prefix v03.post

# the default expiry is 5 minutes (only useful for development.)
# Once messages expire, they will drop out of the queue and data will be missing.
# set to 1 day to recover longer failures.
